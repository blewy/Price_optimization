Research in to Modern Techniques to Optimize Price (Genetic algorithms, hill Climb, Particle Swarm)

When doing pricing for product theres always the issues with "the rigth price". In particular in insurance, contracts renew every year.
Usualy the insurance company needs to decide what is the best price for renewals.

In fact, choosing wrong can create severe profitability issues or the lost of costumers. So we need methods that will allow to choose best
price at renewal given the strategic needs of the company, profitability goals and/or market share. Of course this aproach can be used for new business.

I've used mainly the code from this fantastic book for R:

I prepared an xls file with fake data, with the cost of production and current price for 99 clients/contracts (I thought it was 100),
and created some help functions to estimate retention, volume and margin of these 99 person portfolio.

Enjoy the code and go to the book the learn more about optimization, it's a great book.
